Hi guys!
For anyone who is intellectually curious, I am here in Oberlin writing now saying that we are seeking anyone who's got an interest in any particular object, from computers to materials to medical technology to milk products, to join as expertise in a new world Institute-based system. We will be doing it in Detroit, and probably other places.
For anyone curious in this and how they might write some things about your area of expertise, email me: ed . che [at] riseup . net

Potential voluntary positions in this system, too: summer or graduated, email or give a call. 440-935-5434
